A circumferential incision was made with the Bovie knife through the rectal mucosa and muscle at a level approximately 3 mm proximal to the pectinate line. All bleeding points were clamped and tied with 000 chromic catgut. The outer layer of the bowel was then stripped distally from the inner loop. </p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> The hernial sac, when present, was located anteriorly on the rectal wall and opened. The sac was often obscured by considerable fatty tissue. The sliding character of any hernia then became apparent as the posterior peritoneal layer of the sac was seen to be the visceral peritoneum of the rectum. A large redundant loop of rectum and sigmoid colon, with its attached mesentery, usually then fell through the opened hernial sac into the wound.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px"">The point of diversion which would permit removal of all of the redundant large bowel was then selected. The mesosigmoid and its vessels were clamped, divided, and secured with 0 chromic catgut sutures at this level, and he the bowel was prepared for resection and anastomosis without redundancy or tension. The cul-de-sac hernia was then obliterated by a continuous suture of 00 chromic catgut which sutured the neck of the sac to the visceral peritoneum of the sigmoid at the high level. The resultant suture line had the shape of an inverted Y.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> The bowel was retracted posteriorly, and the levator ani muscles were exposed on both sides. The edges of the levator ani muscles and their enclosing fasciae were approximated in the midline in front of the bowel with three to five interrupted sutures of 0 chromic catgut, thus eliminating the large defect in the pelvic diaphragm. This produced a strong musculofascial support beneath the peritoneal closure. Holding the redundant exteriorized bowel under gentle traction, it was divided into two lateral halves by an anterior and posterior incision made up to the point previously selected for resection and anastomosis.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> Two Mayo mattress sutures of 00 chromic catgut were then placed anteriorly and posterioly to unite the bowel to the mucous membrane 3 mm above the pectinate line. The bowel was next transected pregressively in quadrants, and the anatomosis was completed, carefully approximating the edges with interupted sutures of 000 chromic catgut on swedged needles. This method was useful in compensating for the usual disparity between the narrower lumen of the bowel and the larger diameter of the oversretched anal ring. Drainage of the perirectal space was found to be unneccessary and was not used except in the first case.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify""> Altemeier WA, Giuseffi J, Hoxworth P.

An abdomino-thoracic incision is made from the unibilicus to the edge of the trapezius along the line of the seventh or eighth rib. The chest and abdomen are opened by resection of one or other of these ribs. It is found desirable to remove a segment of the costal margin. The incision in the diaphragm should be made as far laterally as possible so as to minimize the number of filaments of the phrenic nerve which are cut. For the same reason it should only be taken to a point half an inch short of the central tendon. This is important to ensure generally good function in the diaphragm after this operation. A small amount of lateral weakness is not a disadvantage.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> The mediastinum is dissected so as to demonstrae the short oesophagus and stomach pouch. In some cases it will be found that so much extra length of oesophagus can be obtained by this dissection to effect a standard plastic repair. When this cannot be achieved the gastric pouch is carefully cleared of vascular attachments so that is surface is smooth and clean. In order to do this it is useful tobe able to inspect the stomach from below and to bring extra stomach up into the chest.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> When this stage is completed the anaesthetist passes a No. 9 (English gauge) stomach tube from the mouth into the intra-abdominal part ot the stomach. Parker-Kerr clamps are then applied. The distal ends of these clamps are brouiiht as close as possible to the small stomach tube and lesser curve. The object of this is to make certain that the tube of stomach at this pointwillbeasnarrowaspossible. The stomach is incised between the clamps and the free cuff sewn up before the clamps are removed.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> After removing the clamps the suture line is invaginated. The part of the stomach pouch to the left is now returned below the diaphragm and has the effect of enlarging the fundus. Above the diaphragm, a portion of the pouch remains which will from now on be referred to as the 'connecting tube'.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> The last phase of the operation is the plastic repair as described earlier in Thorax (Collis, Kelly, and Wiley, 1954). It is done from below the diaphragm. The under surface of the fibres of the right crus are dissected clean of everything except peritoneum, which is carefully preserved. The limbs of the right crus are now sutured together above and in front of the connecting tube. This produces an acute angle between the connecting tube and the main body of the stomach. As the diaphragm is closed the stomach is included in two of the stitches in order to retain the connecting tube and oesophagus in position. The chest and abdomen are closed with intercostal drainage for 48 hours. </p> <p>Collis JL. An operation for hiatus hernia with short oesophagus.

This was modified in 1936 by Argentinian surgeon Enrique Finochietto to have fenestrated blades (blades with ""windows"") and a hand-cranked lever to both separate the arms in a staged fashion and lock them in place at each stop. The Burford–Finochietto rib spreader has replaceable blades.[1] The Truffier and especially the Burford–Finochietto (and its variants) are ubiquitous in open thoracic surgery. Recently, a new intelligent, automated rib spreader in development demonstrated results superior to the Finochietto-style retractors. [Ref Wiki]",,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_spreader,,,,

The abdomen is carefully explored. If there are no metastases the greater curvature of the stomach is freed in its upper half. The vasa brevia, left gastro-epiploic artery, and the omentum are divided well away from the stomach, leaving a vascular arch attached to the greater curve. The gastro-hepatic omentum is then divided, again well away from the lesser curve, and the left gastric artery is tied and divided near its origin. To reduce inflammatory reaction and adhesions, fine silk should be used throughout and the most careful haemostasis secured. Finally, a loop of gut about a foot down the jejunum is chosen and a size 10 catheter inserted by Witzel’s method. This is brought out, surrounded by omentum, through the lower end of the wound. (If there are metastases present, all that is done is a Janeway gastrostomy). For the 10 or 15 days after surgery, every effort is made to improve the patient’s nutrition by a high-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, with extra vitamins. The jejunostomy makes this possible.</p> <p>Stage 2.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px"">With the patient in the left lateral position, and a sandbag under the chest, the whole of the right 6th rib from the neck to its cartilage is removed, and the chest entered through its bed. If after careful examination the growth seems removable, the lung is packed forward and the vena azygos major divided between ligatures. The mediastinal pleura is then incised and just above and below the growth pieces of tape are passed round the gullet to be used as ‘guy-ropes’. The involved segment, together with any glands, is then slowly dissected free. Care must be taken to avoid opening the left pleura - a serious complication. There is no need to paralyse the phrenic nerve. The lower end of the osesophagus is gradually freed by retracting the diaphragm, dividing the branches of the vagi, and keeping it on the stretch with sponge-holders. The part in the oesophageal hiatus is then freed with the index finger. A specially devised sickle-shaped retractor is now insinuated into the hiatus. This instrument not only retracts and stretches the hiatus with its tapering end, but holds the diaphragm and underlying liver out of the way. As soon as the cardia is drawn up through the hiatus, the peritoneum is opened and then severed all round the circumference. By steadily drawing on the cardia, the fundus and eventually the body of the stomach are brought up into the pleura. Adhesions of varying strength will have formed in the interval since the first operation - they are separated. When the stomach is sufficiently mobilized so that the fundus reaches well above the growth, the esophagus with a wedge of cardia is severed and the gap sutured and invaginated. If any enlarged glands have now become evident along the upper part of the lesser omentum it is probably safe to extend the excision to include part of the lesser curvature, and still leave the fundus viable - the vascularity of the stomach is remarkable.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> The next step of the operation is to prepare a gastric bed on which the oesophagus will lie. The upper end of the stomach is fixed in the angle between the vertebral bodies and mediastinum. Five or six interrupted silk sutures are placed along each edge- posteriorly fixing the stomach to the anterior spinal ligaments and anteriorly to the anterior cut edge of mediastinal pleura. The oesophagus is then laid upon the stomach and the posterior layer of interrupted sutures is put in before cutting off the growth. A transverse incision is made in the stomach. Three points about this: (a) It should be on the short side - it can easily be lengthened, but once too long it will make for a faulty joint; (b) Any bleeding points should be tied before proceeding-the time will be amply repaid by a clean field and accurate suturing; (c) Keep a small sucker with a hooked point just inside the stomach incision.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px"">The through-and-through layer also should be done with a fine needle, fine silk, close interrupted sutures carefully including the oesophageal mucosa in every suture. All knots are placed on the inside. The anterior sero-muscular sutures are then placed. Finally, if it can be done easily, the stomach edges or omental fringes are folded over in front of the anastomosis and lightly sutured. The enlarged hiatus does not need stitching up; it is only about the circumference of a wrist ; three or four sutures are, however, placed between the stomach and its rim to prevent small gut passing through. 60,000 units of powdered penicillin is sprinkled around the anastomosis. A No. 14 catheter is placed alongside the anastomosis, with a second hole cut lower down to lie just inside the pleura. This is brought out through the 9th intercostal space laterally, to drain under water. The chest wall is sutured in layers.</p> <p> Lewis I.

The patient is turned on the right side and allowed to rest for a short period, and palpation then reveals absence of tenderness on the left side and more marked tenderness on the right........This shifting tenderness is easily explained if one remembers the anatomic outline of the mesentery.

If there is an indirect sac, it is opened in order to explore the canal floor and simply inverted into the abdomen without excision, suture, or ligature. If direct sacs are large, they may be inverted by means of a single absorbable invaginating suture.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> A sheet of prosthetic mesh measuring about 5 by 10 cm is fashioned. The lower edge is tacked in place by a continuous suture of 0-0-0 Novafil® or Prolene®, which secures the mesh medially to the lacunar ligamnet and then proceeds laterally along Poupart's ligament beyond the internal ring. A slit in the mesh at the internal ring allows emergence of the spermatic cord. When thinning the cord, if the genitofemoral nerve cannot be clearly identified, the inferior cremaster muscle bundle containing the nerve and the external spermatic vessels may exit through a separate opening medial to the ring. The superior edge of the mesh is loosely secured by a similar continuous suture to the rectus sheath and conjoined muscle and tendon above. A single suture approximates the tails of the mesh to Poupart's ligament lateral to the internal ring. </p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> This alone completes the repair without formal reconstruction of the canal floor. The usual approximation of aponeurotic tissue under tension is avoided. Since the patient is awake and able to cooperate, he is requested to cough and perform the Valsalva maneuver in order to test the strength of the repair. The expernal oblique aponeurosis is closed over the cord with a continuous absorbable suture. </p> <p style=""text-align:justify"">Lichtenstein IL, Shulman AG, Amid PK, Montllor MM.

In the lower part of the incision the sac is thoroughly cleared. The rest of the incision exposes Poupart's ligament and the rectus sheath, and the external ring is identified.</p><p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> An oblique incision is made over the lower part of the rectus sheath. This incision is 1 inch above the external ring, and is just above and parallel to the lower border of the rectus muscle. The rectus sheath is in two distinct layers. At this level the transversalis fascia is very thin, and is incised so that the dissection is carried down between the transversalis fascia in front, and the extraperitoneal tissue behind.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> The hernial sac is easily identified as a funnel shaped structure entering the crural canal. If the sac is small it is easily drawn up; if large, it is opened below, the contents, if any, dealt with, and the sac reduced in size. In cases with strangulated intestine, the sac may be opened above and below. Having delivered the sac, it is opened, if this has not already been done. Certainly if resection of intestine is necessary there is ample room. The sac is next freed from extraperitoneal tissue and on the inner side this dissection is continued until the bladder is identified. The sac having been tied off, the stump and the loose extra peritoneal tissue are drawn together with a stitch that fixes them well above the crural (femoral) canal so that only smooth peritoneum lies over the upper opening of the canal.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px"">One now has an excellent view of Astley Cooper's (pectineal) ligament, and the conjoined tendon is sutured to it with two or three non-absorbable sutures. If it is thought necessary, the lower end of the canal is closed with one or two sutures. As the incision crosses Langer's lines, the subcutaneous tissue should be approximated with interrupted catgut sutures.</p> McEvedy PG. Femoral hernia.

The approach is by an upper left paramedian incision carried high up into the angle between the xiphisternum and the left costal margin. After abdominal exploration the shape and disposition of the stomach are assessed. As a first step to gastric mobilization with preservation of its blood supply, the peritoneal reflection lateral to the spleen (lienorenal ligament) is cut to enable the spleen to be moved forwards and to facilitate the individual ligation of all the short gastric vessels. These should be secured as close to the spleen as possible to preserve the occasional lateral anastomosis which occurs between these vessels. There are considerable variations in the size and disposition of the right gastro-epiploic vessels. Frequently there is no direct anastomosis between the right and left gastro-epiploic vessels so that the vascular arcade is incomplete. The left gastro-epiploic vessels should be secured as close to the spleen as possible to preserve the collateral blood supply. The vessels of the gastro-epiploic arch can easily be identified and preserved by using a spotlight to transilluminate the mesentery. Vessels from the gastro-epiploic arch to the colon are tied individually to prevent bunching and conse- quent shortening of the gastro-epiploic arcade. As the mobilization proceeds towards the pylorus the gastric vessels change direction and colonic collateral branches become more frequent and often require division. By careful transillumination and study of the vascular watersheds the minimum number of ligatures will be required. Throughout this entire mobilization of the greater curvature only gentle traction should be applied to prevent vascular damage. Mobilization of the duodenum requires something more extensive than the Kocher manceuvre. Dissection must be continued behind the pancreas (as in pancreatectomy) so that the entire duodenum and head of the pancreas is sufficiently mobilized that it can be reflected to the midline. In doing so, the inferior vena cava is exposed over an extent of 8 cm. Ligature of the left gastric artery at its origin from the coeliac axis is critical, so that the left gastric collateral branches are preserved and the blood supply to the fundus secured. To carry out this procedure the stomach is reflected upwards and the pancreas retracted downwards so that the left gastric pedicle is stretched. Ligature of the left gastric vein separately enables the left gastric artery to be isolated at the ‘critical’ point. Pulsation in the splenic and hepatic arteries should be confirmed as the ligature is applied. The medial aspect of the abdominal oesophagus is demonstrated, and frequently the presence of a vessel arising from the left hepatic artery to the lower oesophagus necessitates ligature. The peritoneal reflections around the crura of the diaphragm are exposed and divided so that the margins of the oesophageal hiatus are clearly defined. The size of the hiatus is very variable and assessment of its dimension is important as the stomach is to be transmitted through the hiatus to the chest without tension. Division of some of the crural fibres may be required to attain this objective. The final phase of the abdominal operation concerns the pyloric sphincter. If the pylorus is of considerable size no drainage procedure is necessary. However, if the opening is narrow or if the muscle appears to be hypertrophied, pyloromyotomy without incision of the mucosa, as in Ramstedt’s procedure, is desirable. The serosa over the myotomy wound should be sutured inatransverseplane.If there is stenosis due to previous duodenal ulceration a more formal pyloroplasty may be required. The wound is closed without drainage and the surgical dressings sealed before the patient is re-positioned for stage 2.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify"">Stage 2: Right Thoracotomy</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> The patient is placed in the left lateral position with the operating table split and with the right arm raised so as to abduct the scapula forwards and facilitate thoracotomy through the fifth intercostal space. After division of the latissimus dorsi, the angle of the scapula is  identified and pulled upwards and forwards, and the inclination of the ribs assessed. Division of a portion of the serratus magnus is usually required. The periosteum of the fifth rib is incised just in front of the angle and dissected off using a Charnley’s periosteal elevator. Care is taken to keep close to the bone in the costal groove so that the intercostal vessels are not damaged. One cm of the rib is excised with Todor- Edwards rib shears and the intercostal pedicle identified, ligated and divided. The intercostal muscles are incised exactly at the midpoint of the intercostal space so as to preserve muscle attachments to either rib for subsequent suturing. Bleeding is minimal as the pedicle has been tied. The intercostal space is then opened up as far as the costochondral junction without removal of the rib. A Finochietto’s retractor is ideal for opening up the intercostal space, which is slowly and progressively opened to obtain the necessary exposure.Intrapulmonary pressure is kept to a minimum, and the lung is gently retracted. The pleural reflection along the lateral wall of the oesophagus is incised from the diaphragmatic hiatus to the azygos vein, and then from the azygos vein to the dome of the pleura. The azygos vein is preserved for as long as possible to prevent venous back pressure and bleeding during the early stages of dissection. Dissection of the oesophagus reveals its segmental blood supply. Many of the smaller vessels can be divided with diathermy, but more major trunks at the level of the aortic arch and below this require formal ligature. When mobilization has been completed up to the level of the azygos vein, this vessel is ligated with special attention to its distal portion, as it is at this point that the first or second posterior intercostal veins join the main trunk and make secure ligature somewhat difficult. On completion of division of the azygos vein, dissection of the upper oesophagus is continued up to the dome of the pleura. Special care is taken to define the cleavage plane between the back wall of the trachea and the anterior aspect of the oesophagus. If this dissection is incomplete, kinking of the trachea due to oesophageal traction may occur during the third stage of the operation. After mobilization, the retropharyngeal plane can be defined with surprising ease, and this space must be opened up widely to facilitate the subsequent cervical dissection in the third stage of the operation. On completion of mobilization of the entire oesophagus, at this stage and not before, the stomach is delivered into the chest cavity through the enlarged oesophageal hiatus until the site of the pyloromyotomy is seen to lie between the crura of the diaphragm. Care is taken to see that the stomach is not twisted on its longitudinal axis and that the dome of the stomach will reach with ease into the neck. The parietal pleura at the level of the sixth intercostal space is mobilized forwards to enable the insertion of an intercostal tube drain, which will reach the posterior mediastinum without encroaching on the pleural cavity. The thoracotomy incision is then closed without further drainage unless damage to the lung is suspected. If this is the case a separate pleural drain is placed in the costophrenic sinus.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify"">Stage 3: The Cervical Phase</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px""> The patient is positioned as for a thyroidectomy with a sandbag behind the shoulders and with the head turned to the left. While thus positioned it is important to confirm that the posterior thoracic drain is not kinked by the patient’s own weight and its patency should be confirmed throughout this final stage of the operation. An oblique incision is made in the right side of the neck at a level 2 cm above the clavicle and extending from the posterior triangle forwards to reach the midline just above the jugular notch. The skin and platysma are incised and the anterior jugular vessel identified and, if necessary, clamped. Care is taken not to extend the incision so far back as to risk damage to the external jugular vein. After application of skin towels the anterior margin of the sternomastoid muscle is defined. This fibrous portion of the muscle should be divided after having passed a finger behind the muscle to protect the underlying major vessels. The carotid sheath is identified and retracted laterally, while the muscles of the infrahyoid group are retracted medially to expose the right lobe of the thyroid gland. At this point the middle thyroid vein may be exposed and require ligature. Dissection is deepened between the carotid sheath laterally and the right lobe of the thyroid medially, to expose the lateral wall of the cervical oesophagus. If the thoracic dissection posteriorly into the retropharyngeal base has been successfully completed during stage IT, a finger can now be passed with great ease around the back of the oesophagus. The presence of an indwelling naso- gastric tube confirms the identity of this structure. With the finger kept close to the oesophagus to avoid the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the cervical oesophagus is encircled and then gently pulled into the cervical incision. The entire thoracic oesophagus together with the tumour can be pulled into the neck. Slow steady pressure will deliver even the largest tumour through the thoracic inlet. During this process the gastro- oesophageal junction appears in advance of the fundus of the stomach, but when the latter is delivered it is found to rise into the neck to a much higher level than the junction itself. In adjusting the uppermost parts of the stomach in the neck, the gastro-oesophageal junction is kept to the patient’s right and the dome of the fundus to the left to avoid the possibility of organo-axial rotation. After the application of protective towels the gastro-oesophageal junction is clamped and stapled using a Heimlich clamp. The stapled opening is reinforced by a continuous catgut suture, enclosing a generous margin of stomach tissue. Care is taken not to underrun the vital left gastric anastomotic vessels on which the blood supply to the dome of the fundus depends. The cervical oesophagus is then approximated to the dome of the fundus, and clamping of either structure is better avoided. A continuous catgut suture is inserted between the outer muscular layer of the gullet and the gastric seromuscular coat. The site of anastomosis in the gastric fundus should be placed at a considerable distance from the gastro-oesophageal junction. The cervical oesophagus is divided in the form of an ellipse to conform with the crescentic opening made in the fundus of the stomach. The site of the stoma must be so placed as to allow for an adequate margin of tissue to turn in when the inner layer of interrupted sutures is inserted. Great care is taken to aspirate the stomach contents (frequently found to be blood-stained), to minimize contamination. A series of very carefully placed interrupted vertical mattress sutures using 3/0 Mersaline on an atraumatic needle are inserted to obtain perfect mucosal apposition. The sutures are spaced at intervals of 3 mm and the knots are tied on the lumen. Just before the completion of this inner interrupted layer of sutures, the nasogastric tube is retrieved from the cervical oesophagus and threaded down into the stomach, so that its tip is estimated to liejust above the diaphragm. The patency of the nasogastric tube is confirmed by gastric aspiration. In all, about 12 sutures are required to complete the internal layer of the anastomosis. The procedure is finished by completing the outer continuous catgut layer. On completion of the anastomosis the oesophagogastric stoma is encouraged to fall back into the upper chest cavity. A stab wound is made in the upper flap of the cervical wound to conduct a tube drain down through the thoracic inlet with its opening lying at a level just below the gastro-oesophageal stoma. After repair of the sternomastoid muscle the cervical wound is closed as for a thyroidectomy. Both the cervical wound drain and the drain from the posterior mediastinum are attached to separate underwater seals and their patency is confirmed. </p>",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1276657/,,,,,

A supraumblical midline incision is extended into the left lateral portion of the chest through the fifth or sixth intercostal space. In dividing the diaphragm, it is important to avoid severance of the phrenic nerve. Care is taken to identify the phrenic nerve within the pericardiophrenic fat pad. Once the nerve is isolated, the diaphragmatic incision is carried out medial to the main nerve trunk and lateral to the pericardial attachment with the diaphragm down to the esophageal hiatus. This effects only division of the left sternal branch of the phrenic nerve, thus denervating only a small anterior segment of diaphragmatic musculature and avoiding any major loss of pulmonary function. Furthermore, one should avoid overstretching the main phrenic nerve within its sheath. Therefore, it is important to dissect the nerve from the pericardium to a point high enough to avoid overstretching of the nerve when the chest cage is retracted for exposure.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px"">After the esophagus and a small portion of cardia ventriculi have been excised, two main details in the selction and prepaation of the jejunum demand attention. The first is the selection of the major jejunal artery which will supply the segment. The first or second jejunal arteries distal to the ligament of Treitz are short and generally not used. The third or fourth jejunal arteries generally run independent of the major vein and are frequently chosen to supply the proximal segment. Here one must check the branches of the primary arcades to be sure that the junction between the intestinal arcades is adequate.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px"">While attention has been drawn to the arterial patterns, the venous patterns, particularly of the major veins, are of equal importance. Ordinarily, the smaller veins parallel the arterial channels; however, the main venous trunks draining the segment may be spatially separated from the arterial trunk and must be divided with care separately. It is well to remember that the arteries, being thick-walled with high intraluminal pressure, will bend like a sapling where some pressure point exists on the segment. On the other hand, the veins, being thin-walled with low intraluminal pressure, may kink. Consequently, to avoid difficulty, a second detail of importance is to leave intact a border of mesentry along the cut edge of the segment which parallels the main vessels of the pedicle. This effects a protectice zone to the vulnerable vein which maybe be twisted or injured. Additional length of the segment should not be attempted by stripping the vessels free of the leaves of the mesentery. It seems better to utilize a lower jejunal artery which affords a gain of from 5 to 15 cm of jejunum. Terminal branches or collecting tubules of the juejunal arteries are direct branches of the primary arcades, which over simplifies the decision as to the site of proximal division of the mesentery close to the intestine.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px"">The jejunal segment is passed through an aperture in the avascular portion of the transverse mesocolon, posterior to the gastric fundus, and elevated to the divided proximal esophagus. A careful check now should be made to be certain that the pedicle is free from rotation, kinking, or pressure. It should lie loose and easily in the open hiatus, without tension on its vasculature. The various anastomoses are carried out in a standard fashion and need no additional comment.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px"">In this series, the length varies from 15 to 48 cm, depending on the body build, amount of esophagus resected, and anatomic arrangement of the jejunal vasculature. However, it is important that any excess jejunum lies below the diaphragm after diaphragmatic reconstruction. At this stage, it is important to suture the jejunal wall to the edge of the new diaphragmatic hiatus and condition the intraperitoneal arrangement of jejunum by an indwelling nasogastric tube in order to avoid any obstruction of the segment.</p><p style=""text-align:justify; text-indent: 40px"">In this series of 33 patients, in the first 2 the operation was done as a two-stage procedure and in 30 as a one-stage procedure...Also, for technical reasons, in four patients a Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty was performed instead of the Finney's pyloroplasty. The latter appears to provide more adequate gastric drainage and, in our experience, is the preferable ancillary drainage procedure accompanying vagotomy.</p> <p style=""text-align:justify"">Merendino KA, and Dillard DH.
